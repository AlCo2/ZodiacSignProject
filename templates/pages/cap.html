        The last earth sign of the zodiac, Capricorns and their unique spirits are powerful, to say the least. I've worked with thousands of clients over my nearly-10 year-long career as a professional astrologer, and I can confirm that there's something that makes Capricorn extremely special. Perhaps it's their fearless ambition? Their limitless resilience? Their ability to keep pushing forward, even in the face of challenging adversity and painful strife? Or, maybe it's their secret wild side that's very rarely depicted in standard personality assessments, but that rumbles within the soul of every Capricorn: Not everyone gets to see Capricorn ordering rounds of tequila, dancing on the table, and staying out until the crack of dawn — but that rebellious, untamed spirit is a Capricorn asset. I mean, how else do you expect this zodiac sign to let loose and have fun?

Indeed, inside every earnest Capricorn is a mischievous troublemaker (in tarot, Capricorn is symbolized by the "devil" card). Though this earth sign may seem a bit conservative and restrained at first, Capricorn's closest friends and lovers know that these sea goats love to party.

Interestingly, Capricorns are said to age backwards: they become increasingly youthful, optimistic, and playful as they mature. Indeed, inside every earnest Capricorn is a mischievous troublemaker Though this earth sign may seem a bit conservative and restrained at first, Capricorn's closest friends and lovers know that these sea goats love to party.

Capricorn is symbolized by the sea goat, a mythological creature with the body of a goat and tail of a fish. This imagery speaks to Capricorn's bifurcated abilities: Capricorns are skilled at navigating both the material and emotional realms. They scale the steepest mountains — Capricorn rules the knees, making it easier for this sign to climb — while simultaneously building up their psychic fortitude. Capricorns are relentless: They are determined to overcome whatever stands in their way. They have big picture, long-term goals and they absolutely don't want to be bogged-down by annoying details or superfluous information. However, because of their unwavering focus, Capricorns can sometimes be perceived as cold, unemotional, or even cutthroat — but that's only because Capricorn has perspective. If it won't matter in five years, Capricorn simply cannot be bothered with it today.
Of course, this speaks quite literally to Capricorn's planetary ruler: Saturn. The ringed-gas giant in our distant solar system, Saturn is the planet associated with tasks, rules, responsibilities, and — perhaps most importantly — time. Thanks to Saturn, Capricorn is so incredibly connected to the concept of time. Sure, this may translate to Capricorns punctuality or calendar management, but — to be honest — it's a bit more existential than that. Capricorn recognizes that life is short and, likewise, they're always racing against the clock. There are so many things Capricorn wants to accomplish and achieve in this lifetime; slowing down is simply not an option. As a cardinal sign, Capricorn is really motivated to start new projects — this sign is constantly coming up with new ideas! Of course, solar and lunar eclipses will help propel their ideas forward, so be sure to look out for these life-altering, destiny-packed astrological events, as well. It's time to go even deeper with your Capricorn horoscope — let's do it.

What are Capricorns known for? 
Capricorns are known to be extremely hardworking visionaries, leaders, and trailblazers. Capricorns like Dolly Parton, Michelle Obama, Katie Couric, Mary J. Blige, and John Legend are all known for their poise, sophistication, and — of course — unrivaled talents. Capricorns are dynamic individuals who express a unique balance of confidence and humility: They have a grounded, practical spirit that makes people feel comfortable in their presence. Although they're very selective about who they let into their lives, Capricorns are incredibly gracious friends who pride themselves on honesty and loyalty. One important thing to note: Capricorns definitely don't sugarcoat. If a Capricorn doesn't approve of your choices or behavior, they will be sure to let you know. But the great thing about Capricorn is that they will also help you come up with solutions, action items, and practical ideas on how to improve your situation. Capricorns are do-ers, which means they're all about making it happen. You know that expression, "If you want something done, give it to a busy person?" Well, that's definitely the way Capricorn rolls. Even if Capricorn is knee-deep in deadlines and high-stakes crises, they will go out of their way to consider the needs of their closest companions. 

What are Capricorn's weaknesses? 
Of course, Capricorn must remember that not everyone wants, needs, or desires the same lifestyle Capricorn lives. Although Capricorn is extremely ambitious — and their determination is undoubtedly extremely inspiring — it's important that Capricorn doesn't impose their standards on others. It's no problem when Capricorn focuses on their own aspirations… but projecting their values on their closest friends and family is a totally different story. Capricorn must remember to keep their eyes on their own paper: After all, not everyone wants to climb the ladder straight to the top. Some folks just want to live a calm, relaxed, and peaceful existence — and there's absolutely nothing wrong with that. What's more, every Capricorn should definitely cultivate a gratitude practice. Because Capricorn has such lofty goals, it's difficult for this earth sign to appreciate their current reality, believing that nothing will be good enough until they reach the mountain's peak. But the journey is the destination and, likewise, by finding deep appreciation for their current blessings, Capricorn will be sure to feel even more fulfilled when they finally reach their desired outcome.

Who should Capricorn avoid? 
Capricorns can connect with all zodiac signs — the only condition, however, is that they don't stand in this sea goat's way. Because Capricorn doesn't have time for petty games, this sign values honesty and transparency. Frankly, they would prefer if someone was super blunt — yes, perhaps even kinda harsh — because they absolutely cannot stand people-pleasing and ego-stroking. Of course, not all signs vibe with Capricorn's serious, stoic spirit: Fire signs — Aries, Leo, and Sagittarius — might find Capricorn's stern essence a bit drab, while the air signs — Gemini, Libra, and Aquarius — can be turned off by Capricorn’s judgmental tone. Although Capricorn can make a dynamic work with any zodiac sign, these sea goats must remember that not every person appreciates "tough love."

Who's the best match for Capricorn? 
Romantically speaking, Capricorns are seeking an anchor: These loyal lovers are busy as f*ck, so they appreciate loyalty, consistency, and steadfast commitment. Fellow earth signs — Taurus and Virgo — are attracted to Capricorns' ambition, determination, and hardworking spirit, so Capricorn will often fortify deep connections with these like-minded zodiac signs. The water signs — Cancer, Scorpio, and Pisces — are also excellent fits for Capricorn: The water signs are sensitive, compassionate, and psychologically deep, so they can actually help Capricorn connect with their intuitive qualities. Remember, Capricorn is represented by the sea goat, so this sign does, intuitively, know how to navigate more emotional terrain.
